Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

Project Flow:
1.	Data Acquisition and Cleaning:
o	A credit card fraud dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
o	The data was cleaned to address missing values and inconsistencies.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	EDA was performed to understand the characteristics of the data and identify potential patterns related to fraudulent transactions.
o	Customer profiling was conducted to identify demographics more susceptible to fraud.
3.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Outliers were identified and treated using Isolation Forest (LOF).
o	Categorical variables were encoded using dummy variables.
o	A DataFrame suitable for logistic regression modeling was prepared.
4.	Model Selection and Training:
o	Due to the project's focus on applying statistical methods (adhering to master's program instruction), Logistic Regression was chosen for fraud prediction.
o	The model was trained on the prepared data.
5.	Model Evaluation:
o	The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 61% in predicting fraudulent transactions.
6.	Recommendation:
o	Based on the analysis, a collaborative knowledge-sharing program between the bank and government was recommended.
o	This program could leverage insights to create a stronger security net for vulnerable customer profiles and mitigate potential fraud losses.
